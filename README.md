# Server

This code package explores the basics of setting up servers using javascript and VS Code. It follows a YouTube tutorial video by codeSTACKr, committing and pushing changes to GitHub at the end of each section. Steps 1-6 each have their own server file; steps 7-15 are all modifications of the same file (server07.js), which is set as the main in package.json.
